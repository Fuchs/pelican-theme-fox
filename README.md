# bbTheme pelican theme

Adapted version of [Elegant - a theme for Pelican](http://oncrashreboot.com/pelican-elegant). 

It offers the same features and configuration options as Elegant, thus including search, live filter, collapsible comments, Mailchimp, custom 404 page, etc. It is a minimal, and stylish theme that looks amazing across all screen resolutions and devices.

# Configuration

See the official [pelican documentation](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html) for supported settings.
Note that the article summary is not used in that theme.
See the [Elegant blog post by the author of the original theme](http://oncrashreboot.com/elegant-best-pelican-theme-features) for additional settings.
